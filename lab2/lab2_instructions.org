* Lab 2
** Step 1
[[https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair/][Creating the perfect GPG keypair]] is a detailed and up-to-date
   article that will guide you through creating your own GPG
   keypair. Please create the GPG according to the article.
*** Notice that the following section can be skipped in this lab:
**** Adding a picture
**** In case of emergency
*** Known issue
**** Not enough entropy
If you receive a complain like this when trying to generate the GPG key pair:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
**We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 210 more bytes)**
#+END_QUOTE
Please try the following steps before generating the key pair again:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo apt-get install rng-tools
  sudo rngd -r /dev/urandom
#+END_SRC

** Step2
Export your public key created in step one as
your_TU_id.public.gpg-key (for example, zic123.public.gpg-key)

** Step3
Create a message named as your_TU_id.txt (for example, zic123.txt)
which include three lines as follow (your name, your id, your netid):
#+BEGIN_SRC
Jerry Chai
14912345
zic123
#+END_SRC

** Step4
Sign the .txt file you just created in Step3 (for example, zic123.txt)
with your private key using gpg according to [[https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html][The GNU Privacy Handbook]].
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  gpg --output zic123.txt.sig --sign zic123.txt
#+END_SRC

** Step5
Upload the following three files (the zix123 here should be your own
TU NetID) to Harvey:
#+BEGIN_SRC
zic123.public.gpg-kep
zic123.txt
zic123.txt.sig
#+END_SRC
